Code for connected grilling

Motivation
----------

The last time I smoked a brisket, I was bombarded by constant requests for status updates on the brisket.  (Of course, by "bombarded" I mean that a certain impatient Dutch astronomer would rather bug me from afar than come over and help me drink beer and see for his damn self)  To placate the masses (i.e. Remco) I have started grillduino.

Description
-----------

Grillduino is a suite of programs which allow one to:
* Measure grill temperature via a thermocouple connected to an Arduino
* Manually enter meat temperature (via a dumb meat thermometer)
* Tweet if grill temperature is outside accepted norms (too hot/cold)
* Periodically plot interesting temperatures and upload to a website so that the masses can obsess over them.

This should be interesting...
